      <para>Whales are among the most remarkable creatures to have ever inhabited our planet. These marine mammals have
        captivated human imagination for centuries, inspiring myths, literature, and scientific inquiry. From the
        smallest porpoises to the colossal blue whale, these animals demonstrate an incredible diversity of adaptations
        that allow them to thrive in ocean environments around the globe.

      <heading level="2">Understanding Whale Biology</heading>
      <para>Whales belong to the order Cetacea, which they share with dolphins and porpoises. Despite living their
        entire lives in water, whales are mammals that breathe air, give birth to live young, and nurse their offspring
        with milk. Their ancestors were land-dwelling creatures that returned to the ocean approximately 50 million
        years ago, undergoing one of the most dramatic evolutionary transformations in the history of life on Earth.

      <heading level="3">Types of Whales</heading>
      <para>There are two main suborders of whales:</para>
      <list>
        <item>
          <bold>Baleen whales (Mysticeti)</bold>
          - These whales have baleen plates instead of teeth and filter small prey from the water. This group includes
          blue whales, humpback whales, and gray whales.
        </item>
        <item>
          <bold>Toothed whales (Odontoceti)</bold>
          - These whales have teeth and actively hunt larger prey. Sperm whales, orcas, and belugas belong to this
          group.
        </item>
        <item>
          <bold>Blue whales</bold>
          - The largest animals ever known, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weighing as much as 200 tons.
        </item>
        <item>
          <bold>Humpback whales</bold>
          - Famous for their complex songs and acrobatic breaching behavior.
        </item>
        <item>
          <bold>Sperm whales</bold>
          - The largest toothed whales, capable of diving to depths exceeding 7,000 feet.
        </item>
      </list>

      <heading level="3">Communication and Intelligence</heading>
      <heading level="4">Whale Songs</heading>
      <para>Humpback whales produce some of the most complex vocalizations in the animal kingdom. These songs can last
        up to 20 minutes and are repeated for hours at a time. Scientists believe these songs serve purposes related to
        mating, navigation, and social bonding.
      </para>
      <heading level="4">Social Structures</heading>
      <para>Many whale species demonstrate sophisticated social behaviors, living in family groups called pods. Orcas,
        in particular, have distinct cultural traditions that are passed down through generations, including specialized
        hunting techniques and unique dialects.
      </para>

      <heading level="2">Conservation Challenges</heading>
      <para>Whales face numerous threats in the modern ocean, including ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear,
        ocean noise pollution, and climate change. After being hunted to near extinction during the commercial whaling
        era, many whale populations are slowly recovering thanks to international protection efforts.
